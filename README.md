# Why fundamentals of computer science?


In the field of computer science, most people believe that the right start is learning programming, and they ignore the fact that there is a more important and solid foundation than programming, which is the basics of computer science.

> Many people are in the field of computer science, but only a few are distinguished.

This is a humble attempt on my part to provide a Road map that can be used by anyone interested in starting out in the field of computer science.

let's start on it. 🔥
